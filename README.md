This project will answers two research questions mentioned below. For this project two datasets will be used from the National Institute for Health and Environment Netherlands.
The first dataset is the amount of corona RNA particles in sewage water on different location in the townships of the Netherlands.
The second dataset is the total amount of corona cases in each townships of the Netherlands.
The sewage dataset has a timeline from 3/30/2020 to 1/27/2021. This timeline is shorter than that of the total amount datset. Because of this the data will be filtered on this timeline to give a more representative result.

## data source both data files
sewage data in json format and number of municipalities cumulative in json format.
both can be found on:
https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/

## With this data the following questions will be answered:
- Does the sewage data follow the same line as the corona patient waves.
This will be tested by visualization of both the sewage data and the amount of corona cases in each township in the netherlands.


- Did the first dataset corrospond correctly with the number of real corona cases.
This will be tested by checking the second wave and comparing this with the first wave corresponding with the more precise data from the sewaga data.
This assumes the sewage data gives a more correct view of the amount of corona cases.
Because the second wave has more realistic data than the first wave these two will be compared.
