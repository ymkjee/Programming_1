This research was done to answer two questions about corona in the Netherlands.
- Do the corona cases have a similar curvation throughout the time per province
- Does the sewage data correspond with the data from the corona cases?

This was done by loading, preprocessing, processing the data and then visualization of the data followed by statistical testing.
Also a map was created to show the corona cases, hospitalization and death on a map seperated by the provinces.
A more detailed description of this research can be found in the research text document also found in this respiratory.
